# LSTM-based Prediction of CSI 300 Index

This repository contains the final project for STATS 507 (Data Science Analytics with Python) at the University of Michigan.

## 📌 Project Description
We build an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline using LSTM to predict the CSI 300 Index closing price based on historical daily data.
